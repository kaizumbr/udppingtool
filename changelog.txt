For now, we work with dates, not version numbers

22.02.2024:
Merged commit that fixed udpServer not correctly considering the PORT parameter

17.11.2023:
Adjusted how inter-packet-time is calculated: it was from finishing to send until starting to send the next. Was adjusted to be always between starting to send. 

22.05.2023:
- Minor: Added this file
- Major: Changed function call for testing of available received packet to not block at all and immediatelly return. This heavily improves the determinism of request send intervals
- Minor: Main loop provides receive buffer to udpReceive() routine so it does not have to allocate memory

28.04.2023:
- Initial version
